# Meson sekelton code

This repository contains a [Meson](https://mesonbuild.com/) skeleton. It is used in the [High-Performance Computiong:  MD
with C++
project](https://pastewka.github.io/MolecularDynamics/_project/general_remarks.html).

# Compile
cd builddir
meson compile

### Run executables of parallel code, change of domain decompositions needs to be done<br> inside the main files. Executables for all parallel code, have to be started in the folder containing xyz files,<br> special error messages for missing files are not shown, although meson should take care of them.
cd builddir/millestones/07/  
mpirun -n 4 ./milestone7
### data for plots with timestep for parallel computation on gold clusters
cd builddir/millestones/08/  
mpirun -n 4 ./milestone08
### for straining, has to be started in the folder containing xyz files, special error messages for missing files are not shown
cd builddir/millestones/09/  
mpirun -n 20 ./milestone09

### Plots of the resulting files are generated in 
results/results1.ipynb
